The rate at which it increases is sped up by winning difficult battles, winning with few casualties, or winning battles where your own retinue is more powerful than your enemy. Raising your <b>battle rank</b> impacts the strength, variety, and number of enemies you encounter throughout the game—and when your foes are tougher, the HP, parameters, and skill levels of your own characters grow more quickly as well. Furthermore, the higher your battle rank is, the more likely you are to glimmer new techniques. There is a limit to how high your battle rank can get at any given point, and changing worlds will make it so that it can go up again. Winning easy battles will not cause your battle rank to increase. Battle rewards will <b>double</b> once you've reached the maximum battle rank. "
